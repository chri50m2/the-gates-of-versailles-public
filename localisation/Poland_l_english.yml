poland.20.t:0 "Labor Lottery"
poland.20.d:0 "Today came a message from the ministry of economic affairs. The ministers came up with the idea of a 'Labor Lottery'. A monthly lottery where the winner gets a new, very prestigious, job. The tickets cost a lot, so the job will also pay alot. The one thing the peasants don't know is that the jobs aren't that prestigious, and that they will often have to move far away to work. Through this scheme, we can only do one thing, and that is earn a lot of money."
poland.20.a:0 "Nothing bad can come out of this, right?"
poland.21.t:0 "The Future of Poland"
poland.21.d:0 "Poland is at a crossroads. There are various contenders looking to seize power, either peacefully or unpeacefully. There are still democratic sympathizers from the old government. The fascist party is also gaining a lot of traction. Many of our advisors are suggesting that Anders is preparing a coup, however it is clearly unjustified and it lacks evidence. Many young poles are seeing the success of communism in Prussia, and they are joining secret underground communist parties. Still, the ideal future is one in which Sikorski remains in power. "
poland.21.a:0 "The future is uncertain"
poland.22.t:0 "The End of Sikorski"
poland.22.d:0 "Ever since Sikorski and his commanders took over Poland, the people have been miserable. Food shortages and government suppression has lowered the content of the citizens. Well today was the boiling points of these rebels. A group of students, liberals, intellectuals, communists, bureaucrats, diplomats, soldiers, miners, fascists, autocrats, peasants, ukrainians and germans, really everyone who was sick of his rule. The guards protecting the gates at the ministry of defense, where Sikorski was staying, was eventually overwhelmed, in what experts called 'a modern day Storm of The Bastille'. Before the rebels could reach his office, he was long gone. Witnesses saw a convoy leaving the area around the time the office was found empty. His location is unknown now, but he is probably headed to Hungary, Lithuania or Ukraine, where he will reciece asylum. Sikorskis departure has left a power gap in Poland. The various rebel factions, the communists, fascists, liberals, soldiers are already grapping what straws they can."
poland.22.a:0 "We survived the past, we'll survive this"
poland.23.t:0 "Opening of the Sejm"
poland.23.d:0 "Earlier this morning, the country was shocked, but in a good way. The doors of the Sejm were opened. A handful of politicians, known in higher circles as the 'The Inner Ministry', the politicians announced that they would form an emergency government, and that national elections would commence shortly. Currently, the conservatives are set to take the lead, but the last election was a long time ago, and the people's opinion is yet unknown. Of course the communist and fascist parties are banned in the upcoming election, but the newly formed liberal and social democratic parties are a threat to the conservative status quo."
poland.23.a:0 "Thank God, freedom at last"
poland.24.t:0 "National Elections"
poland.24.d:0 "All over Poland, people went to the ballots to finally have some influence on who rules the country. Many polls indicate that the conservatives will win a landslide victory. However seeing the joy of the other european democracies in Russia and Scandinavia, others are suggesting that the liberals might pull ahead. Of course the unthinkable option is that the social democrats will pull ahead. Of course, that is just a childish fantasy."
poland.24.a:0 "A close liberal victory"
poland.24.b:0 "A conservative landslide"
poland.24.c:0 "An unbelievable social democratic victory"
poland.26.t:0 "Steel Report; Warsaw"
poland.26.d:0 "As a part of our national program to become self-sufficent, the government has hired several mining contractors to search the country for steel. They suspected that in the outskirts of Warsaw there would be steel. This would be especially good, since we also have ideas of modernizing our rural to city infrastructure. And indeed, steel was found. Already a new mine has been established and it is set to create over 3000 jobs."
poland.26.a:0 "Fantastic!"
poland.27.t:0 "Steel Report; Lodz"
poland.27.d:0 "As a part of our national program to become self-sufficent, the government has hired several mining contractors to search the country for steel. They suspected that in the outskirts of Lodz there would be steel. God must've had fortune with us, as a small reserve of steel was found."
poland.27.a:0 "Praise the Lord"
poland.28.t:0 "A Slavic Cooperation Union?"
poland.28.d:0 "As Poland has gotten rid of their old regime and finally installed a democratic government, their policies have also changed. Once the dark country of Europe it is now a shining example of democracy. President Wojciech has proposed a Slavic Corporations Union to several slavic nations including us. The union's goal is to promote free trade and unity with the invited nations. Many liberals have praised this proposal, as it will strengthen slavic unity. But the conservatives are critisizing the proposal, stating that it would evolve to become a political union, directly threatening national sovreignty. What do we do?"
poland.28.a:0 "For Everlasting Corporation"
poland.28.b:0 "Freedom Over Unity"
poland.29.t:0 "The Trial of Sikorski"

The court silenced, as the doors opened. Sikorski, being ecorted by four soldiers of the fascist guard. He was firmly sat down in the chair, and the trial began. After six hours, the jury left the court to stay at a nearby hotel. As morning dawned the trial restarted and the jury entered, everybody was excitement for the final result. Will it be lifetime? WIll it be 25 years? Or will it be amere 10 years?"
poland.29.a:0 "Lifetime, the bastard deserves nothing less"
poland.29.b:0 "25 years, enough for people to forgot him"
poland.29.c:0 "10 years, if we aren't better than our enemy"
poland.30.t:0 "The Death of The Bastard"
poland.30.d:0 "As Sikorski attempted to flee the country, he was caught by the fascist guard close to Grodno. He was put into jail at the Mokotów Prison. His fate was yet to decided. Was he to for his crimes with his life, or with the rest of his life. Boleslaw and his advisors took some time to decide, but the verdict has been decided. Sikorski is to pay with his life. Days before his execution, the news was spread across the country. Several people from all over the country traveled to Warsaw for the first time just to see his death. Ironically, he was dressed in his military uniform at his hanging. The public stood at the ground in masses. Stands were built for the elite. Boleslaw Piasecki sat front row. He was accompanied by many prominent figures, among them were all the generals and field marshals of the polish army. After his execution, a fighter squadron flew over the capital to celebrate his execution."
poland.30.a:0 "A Historical Day for Poland"
poland.31.t:0 "A Union Reborn"
poland.31.d:0 "As Poland's status quo has shifted from an oppressive military junta to an oppressive fascist regime, nationalism has grown too. Poland has long been struggling to get over their past greatness, and it seems they never may do so. In a speech today Piasecki said 'The commonwealth shall be reborn, and we will make Poland great again'. After the speech Sikorski spoke to his foreign minister, saying that he shall send an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding our submission. That is what we have recieved. Today, Piasecki arrived in Kaunas to talk with Antanas Semtona. The meeting was Secret, however rumors are saying that it was as much a conversation as it was a commandment. Piasecki demanded that we submit to them, or face the consequences."
poland.31.a:0 "We Have No Choice"
poland.32.t:0 "National Referendum"
poland.32.d:0 "As Lithuania's fate was sealed as just another footnote in history, many experts are wondering what Poland's next move is. Well today Poland announced that it would persuade us and our neighbour to hold a referendum to join the new commonwealth. As we have little in terms of military power against them, we resistantly abided and have held the referendum. The polls are in, and have been counted. What is the final choice?"
poland.32.a:0 "We shall join the commonwealth"
poland.32.b:0 "We shall never be slaves again!"
poland.33.t:0 "The Grand Coronation"
poland.33.d:0 "Ever since Poland was partitioned by Austria, Prussia and Russia and we ceased to exist as a nation, and our monarchy was abolished. Traditionally, Poland had been an elective monarchy. Well it seems that time is in a loop, as another coronation has occured. This morning, at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw, Wladyslaw Anders arrived on his whíte stallion accompanied by his royal guard. The coronation began and he was blessed by the divine bishop of Poland.

poland.36.t:0 "A Reply"

Again, he paused, then looked before the Sejm and began his speech with, “Those who support Republican ideals are traitors to the Polish nation and people.” He then gives a fiery, passionate speech before the Sejm. The speech lambasts, mocks, and insults supporters of a Republic. After nearly an hour of his ‘rant,’ he stops, nods again, and walks off the stage...\n\nIt appears that the Marshal has the army’s support."
