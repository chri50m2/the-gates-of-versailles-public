#Events
england.1.t:0 "March on Whitehall"
england.1.d:0 "In the alte hours of the day, an unusual event happened. The streets of London were empty. Where there's usually farmer's markets and busy streets, it was nothing but the howling wind. For Britain was about to experience something that it had not experienced for a very long time; a coup. The government knew that something was off. Admirals were not reporting in, ships were left empty. Something fishy was going on. So the government ordered all citizens to stay indoors. But that did not stop the plot.\n\nSailors and Admirals raced to Whitehall in armored cars. The guards were quickly outmanned and incapacitated. Capturing the Whithall buildings, the Admirals quickly took the main offices. As all the offices and departments of the ministry were taken, only one was missing; the Prime Minister. Downing Street was missing. Two admirals had different plans for how we should approach this. Percy Noble and Geoffrey Arbuthnot have both written letters to the Prime Ministers with the demands of the navy. Who do we send in?"
england.1.a:0 "Send in Noble"
england.1.b:0 "Send in Arbuthnot"

england.2.t:0 "The Noble Letter"
england.2.d:0 "As the guards around Downing Street 10 were incapacitated, Percy and a few sailors entered the residence. The guards inside were too quickly subdued. After searching almost the entire building, Noble and his men walked to the very end of the building, into the very last room they had not searched. Inside sat Archibald Sinclair in his office chair, with sweat running down his face. No words were exchanged as Noble handed Sinclair the letter with the demands. Among the demands was that the navy gets supreme power in the United Kingdom.

After searching almost the entire building, Arbuthnot and his men walked to the very end of the building, into the very last room they had not searched. Inside sat Archibald Sinclair in his office chair, with sweat running down his face. No words were exchanged as Arbuthnot handed Sinclair the letter with the demands. Among the demands was that the navy gets supreme power in the United Kingdom. As a special touch by Arbuthnot, he also demanded that the navy be given far larger funding, and that the military industry of England had to be increased.

Though now, there is a problem they cannot outrun or solve. The people have spoken. The British Jacobin League has won the recent elections, and that means change. The classes of Britain need to be eliminated. And that indcludes the monarchy.\n\nEarlier today, revolutionary guards entered Buckingham Palace and handed the Monarch three choices. Either A) relinquish all titles and live like a peasant. B) Leave Britain within 48 hours or C) Be publically hanged in London. The entire royal family unanimously chose B.\n\nThe Royal Family stood in Portsmouth ready to board the HMS Magnificent. The government of New South Wales has agreed to grant asylum to the Royal Family. The king looked at god's country before stepping on board, knowing that this may be the last time he ever sees Britannia again."

The admirals and sailors have committed an almost bloodless coup, deposing of most of the government and its ministers. Now admirals have been put into the position of the ministers. Currently, Arthur Power is the leader of the new government, though the situation is still unstable. Though the monarch is no longer the Head of State, he has become a figurehead with no actual power."

His physical body and his mind was carrying a heavy burden. Physcially, he was ill. The Great War had taken a heavy toll on his body and his unhealthy habit of smoking, like his father, has destroyed his body. Several diseases infects the king.\n\nMentally, he is worried about his successor. The succession laws require his son, Edward, to be the heir. Edward, in George's eyes, is unfit to rule the empire. Though Edward was there for Christmas, he had left the day after before the rest of the family had woken up. His other son, Albert, stayed there the entire week to comfort his ailing father. Albert was better fit to rule in George's eyes. But alas, he was not to decide that. He knew that his time was coming to an end, and Britain was to meet a new fate."

 ENG_the_shame_of_quebec_desc:0 "Time and time again, it has been shown that the British adventures in Canada have been unsuccessful. Ever since our disastrous and catastrophical mistakes of the 1830's, up until very recently, the Canadian Theater was the only theater that actively saw Americans and British soldiers fighting. There too, we were outmanned and outgunned by the Americans. Young British men were being killed left and right by American snipers in the tightly wooded areas of British North America. Our failures have caused something deeper. The Royal Army itself has become battered and bruised, left in a bad situation from our failures. Even the high command has been left polarized for our failures."

Serving with distinction, he was awarded the Military Cross for leading a successful trench raid. However, in the years following the end of the conflict, he was often haunted by memories of the deeds he had committed.\n\nThe heir to the throne became a frequent visitor of mistresses, drug salons and bars. This wasn’t just in London, fresh photos of him in different locations across the world cover the front pages of newspapers to this day. Often drunk, or too dazed from the previous night, he is not often seen at royal engagements. Seemingly not caring about his positions, and the duty it held, many of the population view him as a reason why the monarchy is not successful"
