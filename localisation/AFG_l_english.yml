 #Events Loc

 afghanistan.1.t:0 "Theft of Arms from Armory"
 afghanistan.1.d:0 "Many armories are in every city in Afghanistan as a stock of arms in case of a rebellion. However, some members of our War Department have noticed that many of our arsenals have been damaged and the weapons stolen in the Tadjik regions of Afghanistan. While thefts are a common occurrence in our country, the sheer number of those started worrying the staff that someone is lurking in the background to build enough military force to overthrow our government."
 afghanistan.1.a:0 "Launch an investigation into this already !"
 afghanistan.2.t:0 "Arm Theft Loots"
 afghanistan.2.a:0 "More arms for our rebellion!"
 afghanistan.3.t:0 "End of the Third Afghan Civil War"
 afghanistan.3.d:0 "As the last of our forces reduced the remnants of the Afghan Army, we have successfully toppled the established order to make Afghanistan like it is supposed to be; a conservative country based on Islam. However. Now we must prove our legitimacy to the afghan people."
 afghanistan.3.a:0 "Allah Akbar!"
 afghanistan.6.t:0 "Visit of Ghazi High School"
 afghanistan.6.d:0 "There is a longstanding tradition of giving awards to top-performing students in different schools around Kabul. Every year, since the reform of the Educational System by Amanullah Khan, the Shah himself visits different high schools to give awards to the best students of the school. In accord to this tradition, before the winter vacation, our shah has decided to visit Ghazi High School to award one of the best student a prize."
 afghanistan.6.a:0 "The youth is the future of this country !"
 afghanistan.7.t:0 "The Assassination of Nadir Shah"
 afghanistan.7.d:0 "As the sun rose over the city of Kabul on January 8, 1936, the air was cold, and the atmosphere at Ghazi High School was clearly festive. Soon enough, the royal cab that transported the Shah arrived in front of the school, and students rapidly lined up in two lines on each side of the main hallway. As the Shah stepped out of his car, the school band started playing the national anthem of our great country !\n\nProtected by the royal guard, the Shah reached the doorstep of the school and started walking down the alley, shaking hands with excited students who have never seen his majesty. However, once the Shah reached the end of the main hallway, a student pulled out of the line in the middle of the hallway, pistole in hand. Rapidly, he shot three times in the King’s back, and his majesty collapsed. Many people stood, tetanized by what had just happened as members of the guard jumped on the student to immobilize him. He was rapidly identified as Abdul Khaman; an anti-monarchist Hazara.\n\nRapidly, a crowd of quiet neighbors who heard the gunshots assembled in front of the school. When the crowd discovered that their king had just been brutally murdered, they furiously demanded that Abdul be given to them. The guards, overwhelmed, had to surrender Abdul Khaman who was dully lynched in a nearby park."
 afghanistan.7.a:0 "Khoda Biamorzeh!"
 afghanistan.10.t:0 "The Seizing of Herat"
 afghanistan.10.d:"Habibullah Kalakani is a name that strikes fear in Afghanistan. He is a rebel, a terrorist, a murderer, even a jihadist! He is the opposite of what the government strives to become. He wants Afghanistan to revert back to an islamic kingdom with the old laws and customs being reintroduced. He is an enemy of the state. For long, his location has been unknown, we only knew he was in hiding somewhere in the mountains, or in a cave, planning his next move. He sees our current situation as a game of chess; a great game, and now it seems that his pawn just took out our king.\n Today, the main bank in Herat was attacked, and the attach was committed by a suicide bomber. Police took to the scene. But little did they know, that this was a distraction. People on the outskirts of the city saw a dust storm coming, bigger than anything they had ever seen. As it drew closer, they realized that it was not a duststorm, It was Kalakani, and all of his jihadi warriors on their steeds! They were charging to Herat. The cavalry entered the street, and before the police knew it, they had them surrounded. The city was now in the name of the terrorists. Kalakani gave the police officers two choice; either join him or be killed. Almost all of them died. One officer managed to escape. He took a horse and rode through Afghanistan, all the way to Kabul. The authorities were informed, and the message was brought to the king. The king read the message and said one thing. ‘This means war‘"
 afghanistan.10.a:"Death to the King!"
 afghanistan.11.t:0 "Gathering Supporting From Tadjiks"
 afghanistan.11.d:0 "A revolt has no chance of working without the support of the people. To ensure our chances in the future civil war, we shall start contacting local Tadjik chiefs who might be willing to support our future rebellion. This will ensure us to have a political base from which we will be able to seize the entirety of the nation."
 afghanistan.11.a:0 "Slowly but surely, the torches of the revolution will be lit"
 afghanistan.20.t:0 "A Beacon of Diversity in the Middle East"
 afghanistan.20.d:0 "Since Amanullah’s coup, Afghanistan has achieved a state of internal peace that it had yet to achieve in centuries. With the oppressive policies against minorities gone, relations between the different ethnicities and religious groups have eased greatly. Jews, Hindus, and Sikhs have started to be more involved in public life to make their presence known. It is now certain that our country is the beacon of modernity that stands against tyranny and oppression of authoritarian governments. An age of rebirth of culture, arts, and sciences has truly started."
 afghanistan.20.a:0 "Glory to Amanullah!"
 afghanistan.21.t:0 "The Great Riot of 1936"
 afghanistan.21.d:0 "As news of Nadir Shah’s assassination spread like wildfire through the city, the anger of the Pashtun population of Kabul exploded. Soon enough, angry mullahs went in the streets spreading conspiracies that the Shia Hazara and other minorities were against the monarchy and wanted to overthrow the government.\n\nRapidly, mobs of angry Pashtuns took to the streets and targeted multiple Hazara personalities. As violence kept increasing, multiple Pashtuns got into the main synagogue of Kabul and desecrated the holy place. However, rapidly, the local Jews managed to contain the angry mobs out of the Jewish quarter.\n\nDuring this time, news of the assassination reached the royal palace where Zahir Shah, the heir to the throne, resided. He nominated himself regent of the Kingdom and took the situation in his own hands.\n\n Zahir ordered his different generals to put down the revolt and restore order in the capital. After the army entered the city, order was rapidly restored.\n\nThe results of the riots were terrible. Hundreds of people died during the period of violence, and as January 9th approached, Kabul wakes up to streets filled with the blood of innocents murdered by cowards. Now that order has been restored, the government can again focus on the political state of the country."
 afghanistan.21.a:0 "Finally, order has been restored."
 afghanistan.31.t:0 "Zahir’s Coronation"
 afghanistan.31.d:0 "The festivities started early in the afternoon with a big buffet in Darul Aman Palace in Kabul. The atmosphere was somewhat tense after the bloody riots that happened a few days earlier. Nonetheless, many tribal chiefs and religious representatives from across Afghanistan were present.\n\nAround 2p.m., the buffet ended, and the official ceremony started. Zahir was sitting on the throne in the middle of a vast room while each tribal and religious took turns in proclaiming allegiance to the new king. At the end, Zahir made a speech where he announced a new era of peace and stability in Afghanistan."
 afghanistan.31.a:0 "Glory to our new Padshah !"

On the other side, liberals are dissatisfied are slow reforms and the tendency of the king to reject them. Afghanistan is on a major crossroad where it can choose between different paths."
