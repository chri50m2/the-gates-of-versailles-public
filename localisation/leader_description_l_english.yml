With money from the government in Kabul arriving by the month and with Habibullāh’s father making money teaching marksmanship they eventually moved to Kabul where Habibullāh would receive his military education. In 1909 Habibullāh graduated the war college and would serve in the Afghan army. In 1920 Habibullāh had grown in popularity significantly because of his denouncement of the monarchy and his anti-british beliefs. This eventually caught the eyes of Russia and France who wanted the pro-British king out of power. Habibullāh received payments from French and Russian generals as well as from the governments of France and Russia. Habibullāh formed a militia of 10,000 and stormed the king’s palace and took power over the country.

 POLITICS_Nadir_Shah_DESC:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah was born on April 9th, 1883 in Dehradun in British India. As he grew, Nadir turned out to be a strong conservative man. During the Afghan Civil War of 1925, he saw his country turn into chaos as different factions fought each other for power. He then moved with his family to the Punjab to gather support for himself to invade Afghanistan. After the successful invasion at age 52, Nadir is now King of Afghanistan and rules over his rightful land. He is pretty slow to pass reforms and prefers to be slow when it comes to modernizing the country."
 POLITICS_Amanullah_Khan_DESC:0 "\n Amanullah Khan was born In Paghman in Afghanistan on June 1st, 1892. During his youth and adolescence, Amanullah was made governor of Kabul to gain experience in governing. After demonstrating good capabilities at ruling, he was also made minister of the army and of the treasury. In 1910, Amanullah’s father, Habibullah Khan was assassinated, and the people of Kabul hastily put Amanullah on the throne. \n Rapidly, Amanullah showed strong preferences towards western values and ideals. Amanullah dreamt of his backward country coming out of the darkness as a modern secular state that could withstand foreign imperialists. Because of this, he passed as many reforms as he could during his reign to order to bring the country out of the middle ages. However, Amanullah did not take into account the overwhelming deeply conservative country he was ruling, and many revolts happened. Amanullah repressed ruthlessly every single one of them with his army. However during a trip to Europe in 1925, the populace revolted against him, and he ended up in Exile in Paris. \n Now, Amanullah only dreams to come back on the throne for one more attempt at realising his dream of a secular afghanistan."
