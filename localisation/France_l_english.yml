Their address and names were all known by the Carlingue beforehand. The police and military went out and put the major cities under lockdown; Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Brest and Bordeaux. It became obvious to the public what was happening. They started harrassing our forces, and we even lost some men. Some republicans managed to escape the country, with Britain happily accepting them. In total, we arrested 37,000 people today. This is the final solution, which will start the fall of the dominoes.\n\nYet this was but a small victory. We have an entire war to fight out there. But the question remains, who shall fight it for us. Today, the Carlingue, the army and the police worked together with each their methods.

While spending a weekend at one of his numerous estates in France, he and his friends decided to participate in a hunt. Napoléon desired to eat a quail for dinner, and he desperately wanted to shoot it himself. At noon, the small band left the estate and ventured into the woods with guns and a few hunting dogs. Despite looking everywhere, they could not find any quails. Napoléon who was bored anyway decided to venture deeper into the forest in hopes of finding some or any other animals. Before going, he informed one of his friends but not the other. As Napoléon went deeper, his friend came back from a piss and saw a shadow moving ahead of him. He slowly took his weapon and shot at the shadow. Unknowingly, he had just shot at Napoléon’s head which exploded. The police were called and arrested the friend who was executed on the spot. Now, the mightiest country on Earth stands without a leader and no apparent heir to the throne. Therefore, who shall rule the country?"

Among friends, they are known for their brutality and ruthlessness, so people tread carefully, especially radicals. Pierre Bonny, the head of Carlingue, met with Napoléon today to discuss the operation. 'We know their names, we know where they live. You only need to say the word, your emperor, and my men shall send them to a labor camp in the Sahara' Pierre said to Napoléon. Napoléon was dazzled and bewildered at the entire situation.

The French armed forces even control entire countries, the army in [SYR.GetName] and the navy in [NHO.GetName]. They are perfect at handling this operation, just send a few tanks through the streets of Paris and they will tremble in fear. Today at the Palace of the King of Rome, on the outskirts of Paris, Napoleon VI and Maxime Weygand met to discuss this operation. 'The French army is no match to these peasants. We will crush them overnight' Weygand said proudly, believing that the French army is the unstopable. Napoleon wholeheartedly agreed, as he himself is a military man. Together they formulated a great plan, and put it in a dossier. Weygand left for Paris with the dossier, and the emperor stayed in the palace, and with a sense of pride and uncontrollable excitement, he began working out."

france.64.a:0 "A good bust"
france.65.t:0 "A Remaining Stronghold"
france.65.d:0 "Though the Carlingue knows the identiy and whereabouts of almost all french people, some escape their grasp. People that are presumed dead but living under the radar right under their nose, Radicals and jacobins alike. But today a police radio station around the rhine picked up a small radio frequency. It took some time, but it was localized to be within a few kilometers. The Carlingue was sent out there right after.\n\nThe agents arrived at what seemed like an empty field, with fields of grass as far as the eye could see. But there was a secret underground. Before the Great War, there was a great functioning system of tunnels in the area. After the war, they were closed due to budget limitations. The Carlingue found the entrance and cracked it open. The agents entered and were horrified at what they saw. An anarchist flag, marxist literature. My god, this was a jacobin hideout.\n\nWithout any hesitation, the agents started firing on the revolutionaries. This started a great battle in the tunnels. It was easy in the beginning, but as the battle dragged on so did the casualties on both sides. Near the end of the battle the revolutionaries were tied up in a corner, with only one exit out, a small hatch. The carlingue threw a smoke grenade, then a grenade. They went off and thick smoke covered the tunnels..."

After cleaning up the blood and body parts, many documents were revealed. Documents about the brutality of the Carlingue and the empire. All with condeming evidence. And in a bookshelf, there was a distinct book missing. The agents knew what was going on. The surivior had taken the book with evidence and escaped to the press. And before they knew it, it was too late.\n\nThe press put out this huge scandal. The Carlingue abusing their power, murders ranging in the 1000's, anti constitutional work. It is deeply embarassing."

france.68.t:0 "The Dossier is stolen!"
france.68.d:0 "Weygand left for Paris. His armored car parked at the curb of the army headquarters in Paris. He went in and left the dossier in his office. Knowing that it rested there safe and sound, Weygand left to enjoy the night in Paris. When he returned late at night, around 3:30 he went to bed without a concern in the world. As he woke up he noticed something odd, something missing. There was no dossier. He could have sworn that he left it at his desk the night before. Weygand ordered the entire building to be sweeped, and when nothing was found, he ordered the entire block sweeped. The only remarkable trace was that there aparently was a car that stopped by the building at 2:00. The Carlingue was called and they managed to trace the car to the French countryside, near the Rhine. \n\nOutside a small mill, one a green hill, there was the Peugeot 201, the one spotted in Paris. The Carlingue and the Army stood outside preparing. They thought that the mill was vacant, however when a jacoin shot a warning shot out of the mill, the agents and soldiers knew there was trouble. But who do we decide to send in?"

france.68.b:0 "The Carlingue will handle it"
france.69.t:0 "La Peur Rouge"
france.69.d:0 "Having called for reinforcements, there was now almost an entire division worth of troops on the hill. Weygand, in all confidence that this would succeed, he ordered smoke bombs to be fired into the mill. Smoke filled the entire hill, the sky was barely visible. Next he ordered storm troopers to enter the mill. The highly specialized troops entered, gas masks on and all. They reported that inside, there were radicals and rebels coughing, unprepared for our barrage. The troops were ordered to shoot first and ask questions later, and so they did. It was a bloodbath, no republicans survived. Once the smoke settled, Weygand entered the mill himself. He and the soldiers rummaged through the house, to find a few clues. Abel Danos, head of the carlingue team at this operation, found a small book lying under the bed. He opened it and a slips of paper fell out. It read 'Paris, 12:00, Tomorrow'"

In the cover of the night, soldiers and armored cars were transported to Paris. In the morning, just at noon, republicans and jacobins gathered in the streets of Paris to protrest the regime. The army went into the streets to detain and arrest them all. Some lives were lost on both sides unfortunately. The arrested republicans were sent to Sahara to infinitely work on the Trans-Saharan railway."

Our troops have become bogged down and undersupplied, just like the last Peninsula War. It is regrettable that France is forced to sue for peace with Spain, opting for a status quo. The war, dubbed the Guerre Eclair, was supposed to be a short and quick war. However the Spanish terrain and resistance proved to be a great obstacle to the French advancing forces. This has been an embarrassing display of the otherwise powerful French military."

They ask us about giving them Catalonia, in exchange for economic and infrastructure aid. The Minister of Economy told us that it would be a great opportunity to us, because it would solve two problem at once: the miserable industrialisation and the Catalonian nationalism. However it would be an embarrassing feat. The region has been with us for centuries, and to give it away for some few francs is unpopular in the entire country. What do we do?"
