NHO_animal_exhibits_desc:0 "Nouvelle-Hollande lacks many things. Resources, Industry, Manpower. But one thing we do not lack is exotic animals. Australia is known for it's wildlife and high biodiversity. These animals are used for our own zoos, our proud one in our capital. The animals are also hunted and made into products, that are then sold to the foreign market. Rarely, these animals are also exported, alive, to the zoos of other countries."

NHO_illegal_hotbed_desc:0 "While the coast of our country is peaceful and normal, once you get into the outback, it gets crazier. Reports have come back of many disturbing things. Rogue bandit gangs, cannibalistic tribes, but that is not of any concern. The main purpose of the outback is as the illegal paradise for France. Here, France can do whatever they want. Make a checmical weapons facility, nuclear fission testing, prison camps and much more that would never be tolerated in the homeland."

POLITICS_GEORGES_THIERRY_DARGENLIEU_DESC:0 "Georges Thierry D'Argenlieu has had an interesting life. He was born in Brest, into a family of naval officers. At a very young age he joined the navy and helped secure the French african holdings. During The Great War he served in the navy, and helped contest the Italian navy in the adriatic and tyrrehnian seas. He was highly decorated by this, and from personal order from the old Napoleon, he became gorvenor of the Jewel of the French Empire, Nouvelle-Hollande. At first, we has excited and joyful. He had heard it was a perfect colony. But when he arrived he was shocked. Seeing the slums and the poor people all around. With no actual interest of running the country, he'd rather spend his time on the waves. With the french eastern fleet in his possesion, it has practically become his home"
