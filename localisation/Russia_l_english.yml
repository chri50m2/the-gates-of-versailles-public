POLITICS_Alexei_Khvostov_DESC:0 "Aleksey Nikolayevich Khvostov was born into a noble family. As such he has never had the struggles that many Russians go through daily. After finishing an education of a high standard he went on to become a student in law. He has held many positions within Russian politics. Governor of Minsk, President of the Russian Assembly, Minister of The Interior. Despite his experience in Russian Politics, he is notoriously incompetent. He has never been able to connect to the Russian people and he is seen by peasants and critics alike as a Nobles' Man. Many of his Land reforms have been infamous disasters. Whenever a minister disagrees with him he simply appoints a new one.\n\nNot much is known about Alexei's personality, but with him being the former president of the right-wing party Russian Assembly, we know that he is not as democratic as he might claim to be. The Duma Order 1289 ended the practice of jews having to convert to Orthodox Christianity to migrate to Russia, which was made by Alexei, was simply put 'a scheme to gain funding from Jewish bankers'. The practice is still very much around. Many retellings of personal conversations claim that Alexei has spoken out against Jews in much more violent ways. In a private conversation with Alexei, Mikhail Tukhachevsky claims that Alexei said that 'All Jews belong in Siberia'. Alexei, of course, says that these claims are simply that. Claims."
POLITICS_ANDREY_ANDREYEVICH_ANDREYEV_DESC:0 "Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev was born on October 30 1895, in the Smolensk oblast. Already in his teenages, he showed interest in marxism and the liberation of Russia. During the great trouble in the 20's, he climbed the ladders of the Bloshevik hierachy either by killing or pressuring all those in his way. Now, he stands as the leader of the Bolshevik party and his cronies are known to be just as ruthless as him."

##Events
russia.5.t:0 "Our Arms Exports"
russia.5.d:0 "A heated debate was held in the state Duma today, for the questions of our arms exports were brought up. The Russian army has long suffered from being under equipped, so therefore it seems counterproductive for our arms corporations to export them to the market. Still, these arms exports bring in monumental profits as every rebel group and warlord on the world always needs arms. The debate was held on whether to focus on providing more arms to the army or to focus on producing and selling more weapons."
russia.5.a:0 "Make cheap guns and sell them"
russia.5.b:0 "Focus on good guns for the army"

russia.6.t:0 "The First Free Elections"
russia.6.d:0 "It has been called for that the first free elections of Russia will be held this year. The Tsar himself called them, to finally bring peace and stability to Russia. Three parties have already come ahead in the national polls: the liberals and the conservatives. Though perhaps we should also consider other options. After all, democracy has failed Russia once before, causing the Moscow Crash. Perhaps what we need is a radical and revolutionary change. To the right or to the left."
russia.6.a:0 "The elections are called for"
russia.6.b:0 "We shall see to the shadier options..."

russia.7.t:0 "Fall of the Russian Assembly"
russia.7.d:0 "Sine the Moscow Crash, the political party Russian Assembly had ruled Russia. It is a very conservative party and the leader, Alexei Khvostov, is an anti semite. But with the most recent election, Russian Assembly did not get as many votes as last election. Because we have chosen to let Russia be free, the conservative Party Union of October 17 have come on top of the election."
russia.7.a:0 "Let the future be fair and free"

russia.8.t:0 "The Spider's Web"
russia.8.d:0 "Within the Russian armed forces, there is a conspiracy. A ring of leaders waiting to attack and take power. It is the Kolchak Cult. Kolchak has been confronted with this info, but he denied all allegations. Within the branches of the armed forces, we have sent in spies to collect info. And the spider seems to have caught a fly. Pavel Sergeyevich Abankin is a decent admiral, we are happy to have his service. But one of our agets has discovered that he is in this cult.\n\nHe was put into a dark room with our best interrogators to collect info. 'No, I can't tell anything, they'll kill me!' he said. 'You are under arrest for conspiracy against Russia. But we can lessen your sentence. Act as a double agent for us, and we will let you go' the interrogator said. He happily accepted."
russia.8.a:0 "We have our rat"

russia.9.t:0 "A Dead Agent"
russia.9.d:0 "It seemed like a normal day at the Yagodnik airfield, near Arkhangelsk. It was a regular lunchtime, until a messenger cried for help. A body was found on the outskirts of the airfield. His identity was unknown, and he had no papers. Only in his right pocket there was a note written in blood saying 'THE CULT SENDS ITS REGARDS'. His mouth was frothing when mouth. A later autopsy showed that he died from cyanide."
russia.9.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.10.t:0 "Ship Gone Rogue"
russia.10.d:0 "The pacific fleet took a small beating today. As we have fitted loyalist guards on capital ships, there are still some sailors that are loyal to Kolchak. When one mixees those two groups, there can only be a bad result. On a capital ship in the pacific, there has been a shootout between the two groups. It lasted for 16 hours, but in the end, the Kolchak Loyalists won. But victory did not mean survival. The ship was too damaged to float on, and sit sunk shortly after."
russia.10.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.11.t:0 "Confronting Abassov"
russia.11.d:0 "Our agents have finally given us good news. They have a name. Abdulikhat Abassov, Chief of Navy Combat Training. Okhrana agents captured him and interrogated him. He was scared for his life. 'Mister Abassov, we only need your name and your sentence will be shortened' the agents said. 'Fine, alright, I'll give you ONE. Andrei Vlasov'. The agents took him out to a wall and murdered him."
russia.11.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.12.t:0 "Death of Vlasov"
russia.12.d:0 "The info we got from Abassov was invaluable. Andrei Vlasov, right under our nose, was conspiring against us. We knew that he would not be arrested without resistance. He was located in a military base not far away from Orenburg. Three divisions were sent over, along with some good generals. Vlasov knew of our coming, through radios, and he had taken Orenburg as hostage. He had taken and fortified the city. And he had done so well. Our forces and his forces fought for a whole week. When we entered the city hall, where Vlasov was, his body was found. He had committed suicide before we came."
russia.12.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.13.t:0 "Monthly Report 1"
russia.13.d:0 "For the first monthly report, there is not a lot of good news. Many of our agents have been killed in action, many also having gone missing. Let us hope that next month is better."
russia.13.a:0 "Give them another try"

russia.14.t:0 "Monthly Report 2"
russia.14.d:0 "Our agents have given us good news. The Revolutionary Jacobinist Genrikh Yagoda has been confirmed to be a part of the kolchak cult. His apartment was busted by Okhrana. His body was found hanging from the ceiling, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. The floor was covered with pornographic images."
russia.14.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.15.t:0 "Death Of Kolchak"
russia.15.d:0 "We have finally gotten Kolchak. Our agents have been prepared, the navy has been sent out. He remains in his office in Petrograd, thinking that all is well. And all evidence points to him being the main culprit. The agents entered the office and shot him dead, on the spot. His apartment and office was ransacked afterwards, to find any clues to the rest of the cult, but there were none. History will go on without us knowing what happened to him."
russia.15.a:0 "Memento Mori"

russia.16.t:0 "Capturing Vonsiatsky"
russia.16.d:0 "The Russian Fascist Party is a growing party. The leaders of the party are Konstantin Rodzaevsky and Anastasy Vonsiatsky. Rodzaevsky has always seemed level headed, but Vonsiatsky was always the tough guy, the brute. And it seems that it would be his very downfall. He has always been very outspoken about Kolchak. Often claiming that he would lead Russia to greatness. Of course, we sent Okhrana agents after him to investigate him. After two months of investigation, we have enough evidence to believe that he is conspiring against us. After making a fake invitation to a dinner party for him, we easily caught him. Since then, he has not given any information on the members involved."
russia.16.a:0 "The hunter lays a trap for its pray"

russia.17.t:0 "Rebalancing The Naval Budget"
russia.17.d:0 "Now that we have begun reforming our navy, it is important to talk about the naval budget. The naval budget is of course decided by the Chief of Navy. Two admirals have come with their suggestions for how the budget shoud look. Vasili Altfater wants to balance the budget between the navy, army and airforce such that they can all work together better. Eduard Pantserzhanskiy wants to go all in on the navy, placing most of the budget there. Who do we choose?"
russia.17.a:0 "Vasili Altfater is the best choice"
russia.17.b:0 "Eduard Pantserzhanskiy is the best choice"

russia.18.t:0 "Remembering Kerensky"
russia.18.d:0 "Aleksandr Kerensky was the man that laid the groundwork for all liberalism in Russia. Without there would be no ruling liberal party. Unfortunately he found himself in a bad position. When he was made president of the Provisional Government, he had two choices. Face Prussia, or face revolution. For the will of the people, and for all of Russia, he chose to face Prussia, even though we had already been at war with them for several years. This remarkable choice changed Russia forever. We were forever united. We won a hopeless war. Sadly, the tubercolosis got to him, and Russia lost a part of itself when he died."
russia.18.a:0 "Memeto Mori"

russia.19.t:0 "Referendum on Joining Russia"
russia.19.d:0 "There has been a referendum of joining Russia today. What will we do?"
russia.19.a:0 "We stay independent"
russia.19.b:0 "We will join them"

russia.20.t:0 "Byelorussia will join Russia"
russia.20.d:0 "The referendum in Byelorussia was successful. They will join Russia."
russia.20.a:0 "Yes"

russia.21.t:0 "Approaching Radical Generals"
russia.21.d:0 "It had been known for a long time that certain generals within the army were revolutionary. Yet the Okhrana could never find the generals. They were too smart for them, always running around the corner, never to be seen again. Now that our grand plan has been set in motion, perhaps it is time to reach out to these generals. In a call to all generals, the generals finally approached. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Georgy Zhukov. Two brilliant generals, yet secretly revolutionary. They were both tasked with the same thing. Safeguard the coming revolution, and destroy all anti revolutionary elements."
russia.21.a:0 "It's all coming together"

russia.22.t:0 "Russian Revolution"
russia.22.d:0 "The Russian Revolution has broken out. What was something that should have happened around the Great War has finally happened. It started as small rebellions in closed industrial communities, has now led to large outbreaks of rebellions throughout the entire country. They have organized them in local city councils called Soviets. One of the biggest of these, the Moscow Soviet, has claimed leadership for all of Soviet Russia. Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev, a ruthless russian, has claimed the title of leader of the Supreme Soviet and of all of Russia. But the situation is not clear. The entire country has been put under lockdown, as there is yet no true de facto leader."

He united the country and kept the worker's spirit down. But not any longer.\n\nAll over the countries, workers have assembled in councils, called Soviets. The leader of the Moscow Soviet, Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev, has claimed leadership of all Russia. The situation in Russia is currently uncertain. Does the georgian jacobin have the charisma to lead all of Russia, or will it be another failed experiment. Currently, the entire country is under lockdown as there are several contenders for Leadership."

russia.23.t:0 "Question of the Militia"
russia.23.d:0 "When we first started our revolution, we needed some quick militia units to act as political commisars, and to take over the rest of the country. They had their use, but now they are not as useful. We have standard training procedures and an organized central command. The militia should not be a part of the armed forces. Still, the militia represent something. They represent the workers' spirit. We cannot put that down, can we?"
russia.23.a:0 "Get rid of the militia"
russia.23.b:0 "No, keep them"

russia.24.t:0 "Remembering Peter the Great"
russia.24.d:0 "Peter the Great is perhaps the most important figure in Russian history. He was the very first emperor of Russia. Through many successful wars, he expanded the borders of the empire. The Great Northern War was a tremendous success for him. He also took Azov, establishing contact with the Black Sea. He was more than the tsar of Russia. He was the emperor, chosen by god to lead Russia forward. That is much like today. We have a great leader, chosen by god to lead Russia to glory."

russia.25.d:0 "It was a cold morning today. Cold and sad. No birds were chirping, no sun. The clouds covered the sky. Mikhail Alexandrovich was oblivious to the situation. Outside the winter palace, fascist guards were gathering, ready to take him and his family. They moved in, taking him in his bed while he slept. 'What is happening? Where are you taking me?' he asked confusedly. Anastasy Vonsiatsky, the head of this operation answered him 'By decree of the All Russian Fascist Council, you are under arrest and sent to execution for crimes against the Fatherland'. Mikhail said nothing, for he knew that this day was coming. He knew that one day, the extremists would take Russia and not show him any mercy. \n\nMikhail was taken to the revolutionary palace in Leningrad, workers gathered around to see his execution. Vonsiatsky asked Mikhail 'Any last words?'. Mikhail said nothing, only looking at the cold and white sky. His back was turned against the wall, and some soldiers shot him.\n\nMikhail was dead, but the rest of the royal family did not get such a great execution. The rest of the dynasty was simply murdered and tortured by soldiers."
