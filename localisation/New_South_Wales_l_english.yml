 NSW_imperial_federation_ALL:0 "Imperial Federation"
 NSW_imperial_federation_ALL_desc:0 "With Joseph’s Chamberlain demand for Reform into a new Colonial Superstate almost coming to fruition, Britain instead reorganized the Trade and Military of her dominions and colonies into the Imperial Parliament. This was the third chamber in Westminster allowing for MIP(Members of Imperial Parliament) to discuss trade, economical and military plans to forward to Westminster. Today this is considered the most important of the Three Houses, and so many higher up government officials crave for a position as an MIP after their retirement."
 NSW_responsible_for_the_pacific:0 "Responsible for the Pacific"
 NSW_responsible_for_the_pacific_desc:0 "Ever since our inception, the land of New South Wales has been enveloped in danger, especially from the ocean. Therefore, a strong navy was the only answer for New South Wales, because of our unique position in the world. That is why we carry the mantle of the Pacific, for the British Empire, to defend it from any enemies of the crown, and any enemies of us. Rule Britannia must remain constant, for the British sake and for ours."
 NSW_skeptical_of_our_surroundings:0 "Skeptical of Our Surroundings"
 NSW_skeptical_of_our_surroundings_desc:0 "New South Wales is in a precarious position. The great powers of China, Japan and Russia to our north, and the hated enemy of Nouvelle Hollande to the west threaten our very existence. Many in the public are scared of the possibility of these countries declaring war, and destroying our nation at its foundation. This is why we must take precautions with our border, and any possible ‘allies’ that we may have. We will remain vigilant throughout our search for friends, whoever and wherever they may be."
 NSW_a_stagnant_economy:0 "A Stagnant Economy"
 NSW_a_stagnant_economy_desc:0 "The New South Wales economy has slowed in the past few years, and whilst things have been tried to deal with it, such as austerity measures and new financial plans, it seems too big to deal with. If this continues, New South Wales shall be at an economic crisis, and if we go too far, we won’t be able to stop ourselves from falling into the abyss, much like we did in 1866."
 NSW_memories_of_monash:0 "Memories of Monash"
 NSW_memories_of_monash_desc:0 "General John Monash, the commander of the New South Wales Corps, is arguably the most famous New South Welshman, up there with Hercules Robinson. He won many battles in the Great War, such as the Battle of Brunswick, Fulda, and Bremen. His memory lives on, as do the tactics and thought he brought to the attention of our military."
