###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
 POLITICS_BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "Benito Mussolini was born on July 28th 1883. He was a middle class citizen who rose to power in the 'March on Rome' where he took control of the government. Benito participated as a soldier in the Great War, which led him to be expulsed from the socialist party, as he advocated for the war.  His support of the war led him to create his own political doctrine, namely fascism. He himself is rather incompetent at commanding armies, but his general staff is not much better. He is a strong advocate for Italian reunification, as well as being an advocate for reforming the general staff."
