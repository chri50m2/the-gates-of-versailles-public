intro.1.d:0 "Welcome to The Gates of Versailles, a mod based around the idea 'What if the Napoleonic Wars ended in a stalemate?'. The point of divergence is when the Battle of Trafalgar proved indecisive, and later France gets bogged down in the Peninsula War.

intro.3.t:0 "Lore of the mod"
intro.3.d:0 "The point of divergence is when the Battle of Trafalgar proved indecisive, and later France gets bogged down in the Peninsula War. The Napoleonic Wars end with France having to retreat from it's Central European territories, like the Illyrian Provinces, Poland and Eastern Germany, but it still keeps the Confederation of the Rhine and its holdings in the low countries. A whole century of history later and we find ourselves in 1914, when the Great War has just begun. The entente consiting of France, Russia and the United Kingdom face off against the Central Powers which includes Prussia, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the United States. The entente narrowly wins the war, with the help of a good defense around the Rhine and British commonwealth troops.\n\nNow in 1936 the world is about to be set ablaze. Prussia is preparing to unify Germany into one state. Russia is at a crossroads of complete degeneracy and a democracy. Like Prussia, Italy is heading the unification of Italy under Mussolini. The king of the Untied Kingdom, George V, is dying and whoever his heir may be will change the future of the United Kingdom. The boy emperor of France, Napoleon VI, has shown little interest in politics, but has expressed interest in a modern reconquest of Europe. The following years will decide the future of Europe. Will France fall into the annals of history like empires of yonder, or will Europe be under the napoleonic fist again?"
