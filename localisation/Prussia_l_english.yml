###EVENTS
prussia.1.t:0 "Elections!"
prussia.1.d:0 "The upcoming elections of 1936 are bound to be remarkable. The Prussian Republic houses many parties of all ideologies, and every citizen can get their voices heard. Still, there are three parties that are taking the lead. The SPD, Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, is the social democratic party, led by Otto Wels. The DNVP, Deutschnationale Volkspartei, a national conservative party led by Alfred Hugenberg. Finally, the DDP, Deutsche Demokratische Partei, a left liberal party led by Erich Koch-Weser. Although the parties themselves have different policies for the state and the economy, they all share one policy. The policy of German Reunification. This will mark the final election of Prussia, and the first election of Germany."

prussia.3.t:0 "The King's Meeting"
prussia.3.d:0 "The treaty of Bordeaux and its consequences have been a disaster for the german race. It split Saxony in half, along the Elbe. In return we recieved Thüringen. But the king was not content. His hatred for France and love of Prussia has grown stronger. Today the king has met with the the president of Prussia, in his castle. They talked about politics and private matters. But the Prussian president game him an offer. He would get all his land in Prussia back, if he agreed to become a constituency in Prussia. The king couldn't be happier. Of course he accepted."

news.351.desc:0 "The Prussian Government announced this morning that it has formed the North German Confederation. The Kingdom of Prussia which has recently united the north of Germany saw the formation of the Confederation as a natural step towards the unification of all Germans. The various regions of Mecklenburg, Saxony, and Hannover will all have various levels of autonomy. \n \n This event marks the start of the erosion of French domination over the German people."

prussia.4.t:0 "Schörner's Coup"
prussia.4.d:0 "The sweet taste of victory was almost within our reach. It seemed we almost managed to integrate Bavaria like our other neighbours. But the Monster in Uniform has stopped us. As epp found it increasingly attractive to join our federation, there was a plot going on. Bavaria is known for having very great generals. Very talented. The very best generals had been conspiring. See, they enjoyed not being a part of the North German army. They enjoyed their autonomy. So when Epp was drawing closer to us, they had to stop him. Epp was forced into retirement. Now the question of who was to succeed him came. There were various contenders, Franz Halder, Eduard Dietl, Georg von Küchler. But one man rose as the king of the hill; Ferdinand Schörner. The butcher himself, he know rules the country to protect it.\n\nBut the unification of Germany musn't stop. For this train has no hand brake"

prussia.5.t:0 "A New Anthem?"

news.352.title:0 "The Bavarian War"
news.352.desc:0 "It seems that [PRS.GetName]'s unification of Germany might not have been so peaceful as they might have thought. While they had been unified rather peacefully, Bavaria was stubborn. After Ferdinand Schörner had deposed of Franz Ritter von Epp, he had declared a state of emergency. He wanted to protect Bavaria at all costs. But it seems his efforts were for nothing. [PRS.GetName] has invaded Bavaria, under the grounds of 'protecting [PRS.GetAdjective] interests'.\n\nThe international community looks on with mixed opinions. The Pact of Rome sees it as a gross violation of Bavarian sovreignty. While France disagrees with any actions that Prussia makes."

prussia.6.d:0 "[PRS.GetName] Has come with an interesting proposition. They have offered us to become a constituency in the [PRS.GetName]. Many people in Württemberg find the offer very tempting. The latest polls show that most of the population would rather join [PRS.GetName] than stay independent. Being a constituency means that we will have some autonomy. We will still have our own elections to choose our Bundespräsident. But the choice is in Maier's hands. He is the ruler after all. We have no incentive to join [PRS.GetName], other than the peoples' will. We are rather industrialized and stable."

news.353.desc:0 "What was to be expected as a product of the treaty of Bordeaux has finally happened. The inevitable war between France and Germany has happened. For long, France has felt comfortable in Germany. No power has been able to match them. But as Prussia began reunifying and formed the North German Confederation, it became obvious to France that time was running out. And it seems like it has finally run out. Currently, there is a state of war between France and Germany. It is unknown whether or not France will use the tactics of the first war, or if Prussia has learnt. Nevertheless, Europe is in flames."

From Munich to Königsberg, people rejoice as Germany has finally been unified, under a democracy. The new country has already established a Bundesrat, to make sure its many constituencies are represented.\n\nNonetheless, not all German people have been uniied. The Austrians and Sudeten germans look on in fear of what [PRS.GetName] will do. "

prussia.8.t:0 "A Conspiracy"
prussia.8.d:0 "A great conspiracy has been unraveled. While [PRS.GetName]'s advances might have seemed friendly. Business investment and military exchange were all fine. But there was a greater plot. All the new Germans had a greater purpose. They were all sleeper agents and saboteurs. While that is a horrible crime, the biggest offender might be the planned assassination of [BAD.GetLeader]. He was horrified. The whole plot was uncovered by the German branch of the carlingue. Now they must send it back to the carlingue headquarters, to see what our beloved protector will do."
prussia.8.a:0 "Ask France for help"

prussia.9.t:0 "A German Plot"
prussia.9.d:0 "An emergency report came to the desk of the Carlingue today. A plot had been brewing in Baden. German agents had been plotting the assassination [BAD.GetLeader]. That is not acceptable. The head of the Carlingue, Pierre Bonny, has come with a solution. We declare war on [PRS.GetName]. They have broken every rule, being to close to our sphere. They even declared war on our friends, Bavaria and Württmberg. They are clearly a threat to Europe, and they need to be destroyed. But is it worth it? It was but a plot."

prussia.10.t:0 "The Linz Trials"
prussia.10.d:0 "Hitler has been defeated. His evil and vile ideology has gone with it. Unfortunately we never got to capture Hitler himself. He killed himself in Vienna before we managed to capture him. But all of the high ranking politicians are still alive. Arthur Seyss Inquart, Engelbert Dollfuss, Josef Mengele, Ernst Kaltenbrunner. All war criminals that must be trialed for their crimes against the german people. The Linz Trials have been made to do this. A court that will trial each war criminal for the allegations. Although they are criminals, the NSDAP have become rather upset by this, saying that it is unconstitutional. Alass, this is necessary."

prussia.11.t:0 "The Linz Trials"
prussia.11.d:0 "Our top politicians and generals met in München today to discuss a very touchy subject. The Sudeten Germans. While they are ethnically german, they reside in the Sudentenland, in [CZE.GetName]. Southern Sudetenland is owned by Austria, and they will have to be taken care of. It seems that two solutions have been reached. We either strike the czechs now, or we befriend them and have a population exchange. What is our choice?"
prussia.11.a:0 "The Greater German Solution is best"
prussia.11.b:0 "A breach of Czech sovreignty is unnecessary"

prussia.12.t:0 "The Bohemian Lands"
prussia.12.desc:0 "Now that we have successfully conquered the bohemian lands, the question is what to do with the lands. Without a doubt, the Sudetenland will be directly incorporated in Germany. But the proper bohemian lands are still to be taken care of. We can annex it directly into Germany, but it will lead to problems down the road. Or we can make an actual administration, Protektorat Böhmen. What will we do?"

prussia.22.desc:0 "An oil crisis has hit [PRS.GetName]! Our continued war has proven to put a strain on our supply lines with the rest of the world. This has been made worse with enemy bombing and convoy raiding. Our government must deal with the situation as soon as possible."

 ###IDEAS###
 GER_okh:0 "Prussia Military Arisocracy"
 GER_okh_desc:0 "The Junkers are landed nobles in Prussia. They manage great estates where peasants toil away. They are incredibly rich and powerful, but they also produce generals and field marshals of the highest caliber. This has lead to the Prussia General Staff to be one of the greatest in not just Europe, but in the entire world. They saw our mistakes in the Great War and learned from it, advancing our doctrine. But their dominance in the General Staff has also come at a cost. They hold almost all power and influence in the armed forces. So much so that low-born generals are shunned upon by the high command, on instances the high command has not sent supplies to low-borns just because they are indeed low-born."
