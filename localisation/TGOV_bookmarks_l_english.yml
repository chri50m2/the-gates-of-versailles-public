 THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_NAME:0 "The Gates of Versailles"
 ITA_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Italy has been subject to constant invasion throughout the past few centuries. The Italian people never managed to unite which led to foreign powers such as, France and Britain to take control over the peninsula.\n\nHowever times are changing and the people of Italy are beginning to see that they need to unify to repel their occupiers, no matter the cost. Mussolini came to power after Italy's prestige and honor was mutilated during the great war. The House of Garibaldi fled Italy and the people clammored for Mussolini and the new regime."
 JAP_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Japan was not deeply affected by the Napoleonic wars, and stayed roughly the same until 1832, when the United States demanded trade. After a 3-week war with America, Japan created an empire and set its sights on Korea, but after failing to defeat them, the army's popularity diminished, and no one was supportive of them anymore.\n\nWith an unmodernized industry and an unpopular army, Japan has to find a way to survive this age, darkened by the war and tension in Europe. With Hirohito in charge, will they live to see another decade, or fade away in the mists of war?"
 USA_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The United States of America stayed neutral in the Napoleonic ars, but it would not remain out of conflict for long, as the Great American War left America with almost all of the former British North America in its hands. The Great Panic in 1891 caused the National Party to win the following election, causing a new decade of reformism. America reluctantly participated in the Great War, unexpectably emerging as a sore loser. This deepened the divide in american politics and showed the true cracks of the armed forces. The upcoming election is exciting, as it is unprecented who the winner will be."
 FRA_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Napoleonic wars would forever shape the history and politics of France. Being the sole victor, Napoleon reaffirmed his role in France and Europe. Despite having had a revolution in 1832, the Bonaparte dynasty has ruled France for over 100 years. The Great War would prove to be detrimental to France, as the jacobins kept being tyrannically prosecuted after they had kidnapped Napoleon V's daughter. With the death of Napoleon V, Napoleon Vi became the head of state of France. He is still a young boy, but he has shown interest in reconquering Europe, like his ancestors."
 ENG_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Having left the Napoleonic wars as neither a winner or a loser, the indecisive battle of Trafalgar proved to have tumultous effects on the United Kingdom. Almost a decade later and the Great War would prove to also have decisive effects on the United Kingdom. Though they were allies in the war, the ever growing francophone sentiment in the kingdom is growing closer to a boiling point. And with George V on his deathbed, the United Kingdom is about to choose the new heir that might change politics forever, will it be the unrightful heir, or will it be the drug-crazed rightful heir."
 PRS_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "At the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of Prussia was left alone in the dark in Germany, never emerging as a great German power, nor managing to ever unite the Germans into a single state. An attempt was made, in 1914 war broke out in Europe with the main goal of unifying the Germans and defeating the french. It was a defeat: the Kaiser was exiled and Prussia turned to a republic. Now 20 years after the Great War, Prussia has new eyes on unifying Germany. Will the German eagle rise from Danzig to Strassbourg, or will France continue to oppress Germany?"
 SOV_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Of all the places to be hit hardest by the change of the century, Russia has tried and failed across the decades to be a world power. Their defeat saw submission to the Continental System after the Treaty of Versailles. Ever since then it has been a string of wars with their neighbours, some good, some bad. This culminated with the Great War, which tore apart all of Russia, and their breadbaskets of Ukraine and Byelorussia. Throughout the 1920s a succession of failed governments led to the Tsar, Mikhail II, to declare direct rule from St. Petersburg, and announced elections to be held in 1936. With the Russian economy still failing, and their armed forces a joke, what party shall lead Russia to glory?"
 OTHER_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Napoleonic wars have had tremendous consequences for almost every single country on earth."
 CHI_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "As most of the far east, China was not deeply affected by the Napoleonic wars. However the 20th century have been more tumultous and changing for China than any other century. The Xinhai revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty of China, and it left a large power vacuum in China. Several warlords with various ideologies and motives wagered for control of China. The southern Kuomintang managed to come out on top, allying with the warlords and unifying most of China. However the future is troubling. All of China has not been unified yet, and external threats continue to threaten China."
 AUS_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Austria was a major player in the Napoleonic wars, almost defeating France. However as the peace settled, the once great Austrian Empire would tumble into defeat after defeat and humiliation after humiliation. However in 1914, as Prussia was preparing to kick France out of Germany, Austria joined Prussia as brothers in arms, unknowing that it would be the end of the Habsburg dynasty. Now, under the management of the radical Adolf Hitler, Austria has its eyes on reunifying the Empire. Be it the Austrian empire or the German empire, the future is uncertain."
 MON_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Of all countries to be affected by the Napoleonic wars, Mongolia would be last on the list. Breaking away from the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai revolution, the revolutionary fervour would soon arive to Khüree. Mongolia stands as a bastion of revolutionary jacobinism in not only Asia, but the entire world."
